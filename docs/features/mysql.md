Example usage can be found [here](https://github.com/Fernthedev/FernAPI/tree/stable/core/src/main/java/com/github/fernthedev/fernapi/universal/examples/mysql/)

Use the DatabaseManager class for managing tables, and TableInfo for grabbing the data.
RowData class contains a list of ColumnData which contains the data.
[My FernCommands plugin](https://github.com/Fernthedev/FCommands) can also be used as an example of MySQL.
