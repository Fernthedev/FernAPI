## Adventure API
FernAPI has support for using the Adventure API.

Note: 
    Velocity includes first class support for it.
    SpongeAPI 8 includes the Adventure API. Though since FernAPI uses Sponge API 7, the SpongeAPI adventure platform api is used.

All platforms are supported using FernAPI.

The API for the Adventure API can be found [here](https://github.com/KyoriPowered/adventure)

All instances of `IFPlayer<?>`, `IFConsole` and `FernCommandIssuer` are audiences. 
This allows native support of the Adventure API.
